                <b>joyNride</b> is a free crowd-sourcing service which allows you share future voyages by car<br/>
                and save money while sharing the car with fellow travellers.<br/>
                The payment is equally spent among all participants, and is set by the driver itself, <br/>
                as well as the source and the destination of the voyage.<br/>
            </p>

            <p>
                Search results are filtered according to parameters of price, source, destination and whether <br/>
                or not the transaction has filled up with passengers. The source of a displayed transaction has to <br/>
                be located near the supplied source within a radius specified by the driver, <br/>
                whereas the destination itself has to be located near some selected points along the transaction
                path,<br/>
                within a radius specified by the driver.<br/>
                <b>joyNride</b> encourages users to rate the transaction after taking part in it, and even rewards users
                which tend <br/>
